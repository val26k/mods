# Zen.ModLib

This is a core dependency, shared library for all `ZenMods`

It encapsulates common reusable functions and behaviors that are shared across all `ZenMods`

It should be included automatically by any `ZenMod` you install if you are using a package manager like R2 or Gale. If you are not using a package manager, you need to install this manually.

Generally this would be run with other `ZenMods`. However, even by itself, it applies the following: 
- Validates all the items and recipes added to the ObjectDB from any mods to make sure they are formed correctly. 
- Puts your avatar into a floating animation when you are in debug fly mode.  So that's nice.
- Configure console commands to be admin-only default to seed-related commands.
- Relay console commands through another player for server admin maintenance.

- Fixes a few small vanilla bugs:
  - Remove blank PlayerKeys
  - Changes Player.AutoPickup's Physics.SphereOverlap to SphereOverlapNonAlloc
  - Hide the ExitMenu KeyHint
  - Allow TextInput while in Inventory
  - Make sure the fire is actually lit under Cauldrons
  - Gamepad fixes
  - Config option to disable gamepad emote wheel.
  - Prevent logging "Parse Error Platform User ID"
  - Optional Mouse3/Mouse4 button swap
  - Prevent excess stamina drain when running and transitioning into an attack.
  - Allow the camera to rotate 360 while using tools with the HUD hidden.
  - Fix the text on turrets: wordsClumpsTogether
  - Fix ship chairs so that they correctly register as being on a ship.  Some are not correct in vanilla, such as the Raft mast or Longship bow.
  - Fix wolves eat additional meats. The default adds bear and serpent meats, add others via configs.
  - Fix chair exploit.
  - Fix suppress "Too Hard" message when using Stagbreaker to find Silver.

But you should really use this in conjunction with another `ZenMod`, because that's its intended purpose.
