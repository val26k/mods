## FAQ
__How can I see the Epic Loot info when I hover over an item in my iventory?__
 - In the config file, set `showCustomTooltips = false`

__When I use the config manager to change the config values, nothing happens. Why not?__
 - Some config values are not loaded in real time. You must log out and log back in to see the changes.

 - Yes you can. Check config for `showCharacterXPBar` and set it to `false`  

__Why are the star icons not showing on enemies anymore?__
 - If you want the stars back, edit _enemyLvlStyle_ in the config.  
    - DefaultStars = vanilla stars only
    - PrefixLevelNumber = level number before name (Lvl 1 Greydwarf) with no stars
    - Both = stars & prefix

 - You want to set the specific hover text option to Disabled.  
 - Example: _timeLeftStyleFermenter = Disabled_
