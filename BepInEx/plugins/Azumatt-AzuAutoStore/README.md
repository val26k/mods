# Description

This mod pulls nearby items from the ground into containers. Optionally, use a hotkey to store items in your inventory
into containers. WardIsLove compatible, HotBar items can be ignored (on by default), Quickslots can be
ignored (`if turned on in the configuration!`).

## 1. Need to know

`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`

## TL;DR

1. Drop this mod in, start a world.
2. Nearby dropped items are pulled into containers according to the YAML rules.
3. Press `.` to dump your inventory into nearby containers (respecting favorites and YAML rules).
4. Middle-click an item to store just that one.
5. Hold `Y` and click an item (or use `azuautostoresearch`) to find where you put something.
6. Edit `Azumatt.AzuAutoStore.yml` to define per-container ranges and allowed/excluded items.
7. All configuration files are found in the `BepInEx/config` folder. Examples are found in the yml file. 

## Compatibility

- **WardIsLove** – fully compatible; wards can protect containers as usual.
- **Quick Stack / sorting mods** (e.g. QuickStackStore) – UI integration is ordered to avoid grabbing each other’s
  elements and double buttons.
- **Backpack mods** (Smoothbrain’s Backpacks, AdventureBackpack, etc.) – supports storing *into* backpacks and has
  options to globally disable storing to any backpack containers.
- **ItemDrawers** – supports both KG’s fork and the original Makail version for storing and searching.

## Features

- Automatically store dropped resources into nearby containers within a configurable range
- Restrict specific items from being stored into containers by defining rules in the configuration file in
  the `BepInEx/config` folder called `Azumatt.AzuAzuStore.yml`
- Toggle the storing of items via a keyboard shortcut for a configurable amount of seconds
- Store a *single* hovered item into nearby containers with a dedicated hotkey (Default: Mouse2 / Middle Click)
- Find where your items ended up: hold the Search key (Default: Y) and click an item, or use the `azuautostoresearch`
  command to ping the nearest container holding it and see how many exist. You can use `/azuautostoresearch` in the chat
  window. Auto complete for the command is possible so you can type `/azuauto` and press tab to complete if you don't
  want to type it all out :D
- `Favoriting from GoldenRevolver` By holding the Favoriting Key (default: Alt) or by using a new button, you can left
  click on an item to favorite it,
  or
  right click to favorite the slot it is in. This prevents the quick storing from player inventory from having the mod
  affect that item. No accidental
  storing something you didn't want. The favoriting state is shown with a custom colored border around the slot. If
  GoldenRevolver's mod is present, it will read his favoriting file and use that instead.

Designed to be server-friendly: runs on configurable intervals, chunks bulk transfers, and throttles ownership requests
to avoid lag and race conditions.

Includes multiple protections against item loss and duplication, especially when teleporting, dying, or interacting with
many containers.

groups:
  BronzeGear: # Group name
    - ArmorBronzeChest # Item prefab name, note that this is case sensitive and must be the prefab name
    - ArmorBronzeLegs
    - ArmorBronzeHelmet
  Tier 2 Items:
    - Bronze
    - PickaxeBronze
    - ArmorBronzeChest
    - ArmorBronzeLegs


# By default, if you don't specify a container below, it will be considered as you want to allow storing all objects into it.
# If you are having issues with a container, please make sure you have the full prefab name of the container. Additionally, make sure you have range and exclude or includeOverride set up correctly.
# Worst case you can define a container like this. This will allow everything to be pulled from the container within a range of 30.
# rk_barrel:  
#   range: 30
#  includeOverride: []

## Please note that the below containers are just examples. You can add as many containers as you want.
## If you want to add a new container, just copy and paste the below example and change the name of the container to the prefab name of the container you want to add.
## The values are set up to include everything by using the includeOverride (aside from things that aren't really a part of vanilla recipes, like Swords or Bows). 
## This is to give you examples on how it's done, but still allow everything to be stored into the container.

Player_tombstone: # This is to exclude the tombstone from randomly picking up items that fall near it.
  range: 10
  exclude:
    - All

Player: # This is to exclude backpacks from randomly storing items into them.
  range: 10
  exclude:
    - All

piece_chest:
  range: 10 # This is the range that the container will store items. This overrides the global range set in the config.
  exclude: # Exclude these items from being able to be stored into the container
    #- Food # Exclude all in group
    - PickaxeBronze # Allow prefab names as well, in this case we will use something that isn't a food
  includeOverride:
    # - Food # This would not work, you cannot includeOverride a group that is excluded. You can only override prefabs from that group.
    - PickaxeBronze # You can however, be weird, and override a prefab name you have excluded.

# It's highly unlikely that you will need the armor, swords, bows, etc. groups below. These are just in case you want to use them. 
# They were also easy ways for me to show you how to use the groups without actually excluding something you might want to always pull by default.

piece_chest_wood:
  range: 10
  exclude:
    - Swords # Exclude all in group
    - Tier 2 Items # Exclude all in group
    - Bows # Exclude all in group
  includeOverride: # If the item is in the groups above, say, you were using a predefined group but want to override just one item to be ignored and allow pulling it
    - BowFineWood
    - Wood
    - Bronze
    - PickaxeBronze
    - ArmorBronzeChest
    - ArmorBronzeLegs

piece_chest_private:
  range: 10
  exclude:
    - All # Exclude everything

piece_chest_blackmetal:
  range: 10
  exclude:
    - Swords # Exclude all in group
    - Tier 2 Items # Exclude all in group
    - Bows # Exclude all in group
  includeOverride: # If the item is in the groups above, say, you were using a predefined group but want to override just one item to be ignored and allow storing it
    - BowFineWood
    - Wood
    - Bronze

rk_cabinet: # rk_ is typically the prefix for containers coming from RockerKitten's mods
  range: 10
  exclude:
    - Food
  includeOverride:
    - Food

rk_cabinet2:
  range: 10
  exclude:
    - Food
  includeOverride:
    - Food

rk_barrel:
  range: 10
  exclude:
    - Armor
    - Swords

rk_barrel2:
  range: 10
  exclude:
    - Armor
    - Swords

rk_crate:
  range: 10
  exclude:
    - Armor
    - Swords
