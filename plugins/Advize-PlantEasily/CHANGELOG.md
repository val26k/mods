## Performance:

- Multiple optimization passes for every line of code.

- Improved per-frame placement and snapping performance by ~5500%!
	- Implemented batching for placement ghost updates.
	- Added [Performance]GhostUpdateBatchSize config option.
	- Roughly 56x faster per placement ghost (from 0.045ms to 0.0008ms).

- Reduced input polling performance impact by over 50%.
	- Removed input polling entirely for tools that aren't the cultivator.

## User Experience:

- PlantEasily practically knows what you want to do before you do it.
- Grid orientation is remembered as you cycle through snap points.
	- Updates only when root ghost is rotated or when snapping to a different grid.
	- Still avoids overlapping placements.
